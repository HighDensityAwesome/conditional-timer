This is a simple conditional shutdown "timer". Currently the program is configured to shutdown 
after a file has been successfully downloaded (using Google Chrome).

The program continually looks to see if a path (the filename that Unconfirmed\ xxxxxx.crdownload
will eventually be changed to) exists, and if it does, initialise graceful shutdown (with a
slight delay to allow the download to "settle" and name and save the download etc.

# NOTE #
Currently the program has to be run with "sudo python ${FILE-NAME.py}" as shutdown requires
sudo

# TO DO #
Look into modifying program so that it doesn't need to be run with sudo (calling sudo in os.sysyem
and piping in known sudo password, OR even further letting the program find sudo password - will 
most likely need to be given certain chmod value to allow this, dangerous?)
